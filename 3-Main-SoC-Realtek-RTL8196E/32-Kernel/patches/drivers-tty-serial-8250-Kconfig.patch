+	  This driver provides support for the UART controller found on
+	  Realtek RTL8196E SoCs. It handles the SoC-specific hardware flow
+	  control register that must be configured for proper RTS/CTS
+	  operation.
+
+	  This is particularly important when interfacing with devices like
+	  the EFR32 Zigbee module that require strict hardware flow control.
+
+	  If you have a system using an RTL8196E SoC and wish to enable
+	  hardware flow control on UART1, say Y to this option.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.

	  This driver supports the integrated Ethernet controller found on
	  Realtek RTL8196E and similar SoCs. This is a simplified single-port
	  driver derived from the Linux 2.6.30 SDK driver.

	  The driver supports:
	  - Single physical Ethernet port (port 4)
	  - Hardware checksum offload
	  - VLAN support
	  - Integrated 6-port switch

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called rtl819x.

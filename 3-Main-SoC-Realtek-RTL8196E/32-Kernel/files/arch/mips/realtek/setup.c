/*
 * Realtek RTL819x Platform Initialization
 *
 * This file implements the core platform-specific initialization code for
 * Realtek RTL819x MIPS SoCs (RTL8196E, RTL8197D, etc.). It handles:
 *
 * - Memory subsystem setup and device tree initialization
 * - Power management (system restart, halt, CPU idle)
 * - System controller register mapping
 * - Clock and timer initialization
 * - Platform identification
 *
 * The RTL819x series uses the RLX4181 CPU core (a Lexra-based MIPS-like
 * processor) and provides standard MIPS platform hooks for early boot and
 * hardware initialization.

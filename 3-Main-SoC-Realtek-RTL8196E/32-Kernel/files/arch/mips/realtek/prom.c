/*
 * Realtek RTL819x Early Boot and Console Initialization
 *
 * This file handles the very early initialization phase of the kernel boot
 * process, specifically setting up the early console (bootconsole) that allows
 * kernel messages to be displayed before the full serial driver is loaded.
 *
 * The RTL819x SoCs use standard 16550A-compatible UARTs, allowing us to use
 * the generic 8250 early printk support provided by the MIPS architecture.

/**
 * prom_init() - Initialize the early boot console
 *
 * This function is called very early in the kernel boot sequence, before
 * memory management, device drivers, or most kernel subsystems are initialized.
 * Its sole purpose is to configure a minimal serial console that can display
 * kernel printk() messages during early boot.
 *
 * The function uses the generic MIPS 8250 early printk infrastructure to
 * set up UART0 with the following parameters:
 * - Base address: 0xB8002000 (UART0)
 * - Register shift: 2 (registers are 32-bit aligned, 4 bytes apart)
 * - Divisor: 30000 (for baud rate calculation with 200MHz bus clock)
 *
 * The actual baud rate will be configured by the bootloader before the kernel
 * starts, and this setup just ensures we can use the UART for output.
 *
 * Note: This is enabled by CONFIG_USE_GENERIC_EARLY_PRINTK_8250 in Kconfig

 * finished using any PROM services to release that memory back to the
 * kernel's memory management system.
 *
 * For RTL819x SoCs, the bootloader (typically U-Boot or proprietary Realtek
 * bootloader) does not reserve any persistent memory regions that need to
 * be freed, so this function is a no-op.

 * required interface, even if it does nothing on this platform.

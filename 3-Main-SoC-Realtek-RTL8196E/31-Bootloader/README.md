# Open-Source Bootloader for RTL8196E

Replacement bootloader for the Lidl Silvercrest Zigbee gateway (RTL8196E SoC).

## Why use this bootloader

This is the **last missing piece** that makes the entire gateway firmware stack fully open-source — from bootloader to kernel, rootfs, and Zigbee radio firmware.

**Modern toolchain** — Built with GCC 8.5 / musl (crosstool-NG), replacing the legacy Realtek RSDK (GCC 4.6). The code has been simplified and made portable to standard toolchains.

**Clean boot header** — The stock bootloader prints verbose, cluttered output. This version shows only what matters:

```
Realtek RTL8196E  CPU: 400MHz  RAM: 32MB  Flash: GD25Q128
Bootloader: V2.2 - 2026.02.10-18:30+0100 - J. Nilo
```

**Download progress in %** — The stock bootloader prints endless `.` or `#` characters that flood the serial console during TFTP transfers. This version shows a clean percentage indicator:

```
Flashing: 76%
```

**Risk-free testing** — The build generates a `test.bin` image that runs entirely from RAM without touching flash. Load it via TFTP, jump to it, and test your bootloader changes live — no risk of bricking. See the [Testing Guide](doc/TESTING.md) for the full workflow.

## Building

```bash
./build_bootloader.sh          # build all variants
./build_bootloader.sh clean    # clean
```

Outputs:
- `boot_noreboot.bin` — stays in download mode after boot-code flash (safe default)
- `boot_reboot.bin` — auto-reboots after boot-code flash
- `btcode/build/test.bin` — RAM-test image (test without flashing)

## Flashing

### Prerequisites

- Serial adapter connected (38400 8N1)
- Ethernet cable between PC and gateway
- PC on `192.168.1.x` (e.g. `192.168.1.1`)

### Step 1 — Enter download mode

Power on the gateway and press **ESC** repeatedly until the `<RealTek>` prompt appears.

### Step 2 — Send the bootloader via TFTP

```bash
tftp -m binary 192.168.1.6 -c put boot_reboot.bin
```

The bootloader auto-detects the image type, flashes it, and reboots. That's it.

For a safer approach (no auto-reboot), use `boot_noreboot.bin` instead and reboot manually from the serial console:
```
<RealTek>J BFC00000
```

### Flashing kernel, rootfs, or userdata

Same workflow — just send the image with the right Realtek header:

```bash
tftp -m binary 192.168.1.6 -c put rootfs.bin     Will not reboot
tftp -m binary 192.168.1.6 -c put userdata.bin   Will not reboot
tftp -m binary 192.168.1.6 -c put kernel.img     Will reboot
```

The bootloader identifies each image by its header signature and writes it to the correct flash partition.

## Safety

- **Never flash mtd0** without a backup and SPI programmer on hand
- The bootloader is the only recovery path if the device bricks (short of desoldering the flash chip)
- Always verify TFTP transfers completed before rebooting
- Use `boot_noreboot.bin` when testing — it stays in download mode after flashing

## Option 1: Flash Pre-built Firmware (Recommended)

A pre-built firmware is available in the `firmware/` directory. This is the quickest way to get started.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install universal-silabs-flasher** (see [22-Backup-Flash-Restore](../22-Backup-Flash-Restore/) for details)

2. **Restart serialgateway with `-f` flag:**

   By default, `serialgateway` runs with hardware flow control enabled. The flasher requires flow control to be **disabled** to communicate with the bootloader.

   On the gateway via SSH:
   ```bash
   killall serialgateway && serialgateway -f
   ```

   The `-f` flag disables hardware flow control, allowing the flasher to reset the EFR32 into bootloader mode.

   **Important:** Close all SSH sessions connected to the gateway before flashing. Active sessions with open connections to port 8888 (e.g., `nc`, previous flasher runs) can interfere with `universal-silabs-flasher`.

### Flash

```bash
universal-silabs-flasher \
    --device socket://192.168.1.X:8888 \
    flash --firmware firmware/z3-router-7.5.1.gbl
```

### After flashing

Reboot the gateway to restore normal serialgateway operation:
```bash
reboot
```

The router firmware runs autonomously — no host application needed. You can leave serialgateway running normally or stop it entirely.

---

## Option 2: Build from Source

For users who want to customize network parameters, modify the code, or use a different EmberZNet version.

### Prerequisites

Install Silicon Labs tools (see `1-Build-Environment/12-silabs-toolchain/`):

```bash
cd 1-Build-Environment/12-silabs-toolchain
./install_silabs.sh
```

This installs:
- `slc-cli` - Silicon Labs Configurator
- `arm-none-eabi-gcc` - ARM GCC toolchain
- `commander` - Simplicity Commander
- Gecko SDK with EmberZNet

### Build

```bash
cd 2-Zigbee-Radio-Silabs-EFR32/27-Router
./build_router.sh
```

### Output

```
firmware/
└── z3-router-7.5.1.gbl   # For UART/Xmodem flashing
```

Other formats (.s37, .hex, .bin) are generated in `build/` but not saved.

### Customization

Edit `patches/z3-router.slcp` to modify network parameters:

```yaml
configuration:
- {name: EMBER_MAX_END_DEVICE_CHILDREN, value: '16'}  # Max child devices
- {name: EMBER_SOURCE_ROUTE_TABLE_SIZE, value: '50'}  # Route table entries
- {name: EMBER_PACKET_BUFFER_COUNT, value: '64'}      # Packet buffers
```

### Clean

```bash
./build_router.sh clean
```

### Flash

**Via network (same as Option 1):**
```bash
# On gateway: killall serialgateway && serialgateway -f
# Important: close all SSH sessions before flashing !
universal-silabs-flasher \
    --device socket://192.168.1.X:8888 \
    flash --firmware firmware/z3-router-7.5.1.gbl
# Then reboot gateway
```

**Via J-Link/SWD** (if you have physical access to the SWD pads):
```bash
commander flash build/debug/z3-router.s37 \
    --device EFR32MG1B232F256GM48
```

## Usage

### Joining a Network

#### How it works

The join process requires coordination between the **coordinator** (Z2M) and the **router**:

1. **Coordinator** must have **permit join enabled** - it broadcasts beacons to announce it accepts new devices
2. **Router** performs **network steering** - it scans all channels looking for beacons
3. If the router finds a beacon during its scan → **join succeeds**
4. If no beacon is found → **error 0x70** (EMBER_NO_BEACONS) and automatic retry

#### Automatic retry behavior

The router automatically attempts to join:
- **At boot**: Network steering starts 3 seconds after power-on
- **On failure**: Retries every **10 seconds** automatically
- **Continuous**: Keeps retrying until it successfully joins a network

#### Steps to join

1. **Enable permit join** on your Zigbee coordinator:
   - Zigbee2MQTT: Settings → "Permit join" (or via web UI)
   - Home Assistant ZHA: "Add device"

2. **Power on** the gateway with the router firmware (or reset it)

3. **Wait** for the router to appear (usually 10-30 seconds)

Since the router retries every 10 seconds, you just need to ensure permit join stays enabled long enough (at least 15-20 seconds) for the next retry cycle.

#### What the router does

- Scans all Zigbee channels (11-26)
- Finds networks with permit join enabled
- Joins using the default install code
- Starts routing mesh traffic

### Verification

After flashing and powering on, you should see the router join in Zigbee2MQTT logs:

```
info  Zigbee: allowing new devices to join.
info  Device '0x847127fffe422cfe' joined
info  Starting interview of '0x847127fffe422cfe'
info  Successfully interviewed '0x847127fffe422cfe', device has successfully been paired
warning  Device '0x847127fffe422cfe' with Zigbee model 'LidlRouter' and manufacturer name
         'Silvercrest' is NOT supported, please follow https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/...
```

The device will appear in Z2M with these properties:

![Router in Zigbee2MQTT](images/z2m-router-joined.png)

| Property | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Device type | Router | Zigbee device type |
| Zigbee Model | LidlRouter + Silvercrest | ZCL Basic Cluster attributes (modelID + manufacturerName) |
| Model | LidlRouter (Unsupported) | Z2M device database (no definition for this device) |
| Firmware ID | 1.0.0 | ZCL Basic Cluster attribute (swBuildId) |
| Power | Mains (single phase) | ZCL Basic Cluster attribute (powerSource) |

**Zigbee Model vs Model:** The "Zigbee Model" field shows raw values read from the device during interview (modelID and manufacturerName from ZCL Basic Cluster). The "Model" field shows the friendly name from Z2M's device definition database. For supported devices (e.g., Ikea bulbs), these differ. For unsupported devices like this router, Z2M copies the Zigbee Model and shows "Unsupported".

### About the "Not Supported" Warning

The **"Not supported"** warning in Zigbee2MQTT is **expected and normal** for this device.

This happens because:
1. The router firmware only implements the **Basic cluster** (mandatory minimum)
2. Z2M has no device definition file for "LidlRouter"
3. A pure router has no controllable features to expose

**This does NOT affect functionality.** The router still:
- Routes mesh traffic between devices
- Extends network coverage
- Supports end-device children
- Appears in the network map

The warning simply means Z2M cannot expose any controllable features (switches, sensors, etc.) because a pure router has none to expose. You can safely ignore this warning.

### Verify Routing

Check routing is working:
- Other devices should show routes through this router
- Network map shows the router with connections to neighbors

## Technical Details

### Mini-CLI for Bootloader and Network Management

The firmware includes a lightweight CLI (~3KB) that allows reflashing without J-Link and managing the Zigbee network.

#### Commands

| Command | Response | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | `stack ver. [7.5.1.0]` | Show stack version |
| `bootloader reboot` | `Rebooting...` | Enter Gecko bootloader |
| `info` | `Zigbee Router - EmberZNet 7.5.1` | Show firmware info |
| `network status` | `Network: JOINED (channel 15, PAN 0x1234)` | Show network status |
| `network leave` | `Leaving network...` | Leave current network |
| `network steer` | `Starting network steering...` | Join an open network |
| `help` | Command list | Show available commands |

#### Architecture

```

#### Direct usage from remote host (via netcat) — Recommended

This is the preferred method because it provides local echo of typed commands.

```bash
# Ensure serialgateway is running on the gateway (default after boot)

# From your PC:
jnilo@jnilo-Key-R:~$ nc 192.168.1.126 8888
help
Commands:
  version           - Show stack version
  bootloader reboot - Enter bootloader
  info              - Show device info
  network status    - Show network status
  network leave     - Leave current network
  network steer     - Join an open network
  help              - Show this help
> info
Zigbee Router - EmberZNet 7.5.1
> network status
Network: JOINED (channel 11, PAN 0x1A62)
> version
stack ver. [7.5.1.0]
> ^C
jnilo@jnilo-Key-R:~$ 
```

#### Direct usage from the gateway (via SSH)

```bash
~ # killall serialgateway
~ # microcom -s 115200 /dev/ttyS1
Commands:
  version           - Show stack version
  bootloader reboot - Enter bootloader
  info              - Show device info
  network status    - Show network status
  network leave     - Leave current network
  network steer     - Join an open network
  help              - Show this help
> Zigbee Router - EmberZNet 7.5.1
> Network: JOINED (channel 11, PAN 0x1A62)
> stack ver. [7.5.1.0]
>
# To exit microcom: Ctrl+X
```

**Note:** When using microcom on the gateway, there is no local echo of typed characters (commands `help`, `info`, `network status`, `version` were typed above). Commands still work - just type and press Enter.

#### Usage with `universal-silabs-flasher`

The flasher automatically detects the Router firmware and uses `bootloader reboot` to enter bootloader mode:
```bash
# On gateway: killall serialgateway && serialgateway -f
# Important: close all SSH sessions before flashing !
universal-silabs-flasher \
    --device socket://192.168.1.X:8888 \
    flash --firmware new-firmware.gbl
```
This allows you to reflash the router without physical access. Unlike NCP firmware (which uses EZSP commands), the Router firmware uses CLI commands for bootloader entry.

### ZCL Configuration

Flash (256KB):
├── Application     ~186KB
├── NVM3 Storage     36KB
└── Free            ~34KB

## Removed Features (Flash Savings)

The following components were excluded to minimize flash usage:

| Component | Savings | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Full CLI | ~28KB | Replaced by mini-CLI (~2KB) |
| Debug Print | ~10KB | No debug output |
| Green Power | ~50KB | Not used |
| Zigbee Light Link | ~40KB | Not a lighting device |
| Identify Cluster | ~4KB | No LED for feedback |
| Find-and-Bind | ~8KB | Router doesn't initiate bindings |

### Impact of Removed Features

- **No Identify**: The "Identify" button in Z2M/ZHA won't trigger any visual feedback (the gateway has no accessible LED anyway)
- **No Find-and-Bind**: Cannot do direct device-to-device binding (not needed for a pure router)
- **Mini-CLI only**: The full CLI framework (~28KB) is replaced by a lightweight mini-CLI (~3KB) with essential commands for bootloader access and network management

All core routing functionality is preserved.

## Troubleshooting

### Router doesn't join

#### Quick checklist

1. **Check permit join** is enabled on coordinator and stays enabled for at least 20 seconds
2. **Verify Z2M is running** - The coordinator must be active to respond to beacons
3. **Check distance** - Move closer to coordinator for initial join
4. **Wait for retry** - The router retries every 10 seconds automatically

#### Debugging via Mini-CLI

Connect to the router's serial console to see what's happening:

```bash
# On the gateway via SSH:
killall serialgateway
microcom -s 115200 /dev/ttyS1
# To exit microcom: Ctrl+X

# Or from remote host (if serialgateway is running):
nc 192.168.1.X 8888
# To exit nc: Ctrl+C
```

Then use these commands:

| Command | Expected result |
|---------|-----------------|
| `network status` | Shows `JOINED` or `NOT JOINED` |
| `network steer` | Manually triggers join attempt |

#### Common error codes

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `0x70` | EMBER_NO_BEACONS - No coordinator found | Enable permit join on Z2M and wait for retry |
| `0x93` | EMBER_NO_NETWORK_KEY_RECEIVED | Network security issue - try erasing chip and reflashing |

#### Reset NVM (clear stored network data)

If the router was previously joined to a different network, it may need a full erase:

**Via J-Link:**
```bash
commander device masserase --device EFR32MG1B232F256GM48
commander flash firmware/z3-router-7.5.1.s37 --device EFR32MG1B232F256GM48
```

**Via UART:** Flash the firmware again with `universal-silabs-flasher` - this erases the NVM.

### Router joins but doesn't route

1. **Wait** - Route discovery takes time (minutes)
2. **Check coordinator** - Some need "interview" to complete
3. **Verify in network map** - Router should show connections

### After reflashing, Z2M shows old device info (Model, Firmware ID)

Z2M caches device attributes from the initial interview. If you reflash the router with modified attributes (Model Identifier, SW Build ID, etc.), Z2M will still show the old values.

**Solution:** Force a re-interview in Z2M:

1. Go to the device page in Z2M web UI
2. Click the **"Interview"** button (or "Reconfigure" in some versions)
3. Wait for the interview to complete

Alternatively, delete the device from Z2M and let it rejoin:
1. Remove the device in Z2M
2. On the router, run `network leave` then `network steer`
3. The router will rejoin with fresh attribute values

### Build fails with "zap-config.h not found"

The ZAP files are pre-generated in `patches/`. Ensure they're copied:
```bash
ls patches/zap-*.h
```

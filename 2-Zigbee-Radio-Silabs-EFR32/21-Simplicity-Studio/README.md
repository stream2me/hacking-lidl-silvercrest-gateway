## 4. Additional Notes

- **Administrator Privileges**: On some Linux systems, you may need to run
  Simplicity Studio as root.
  ```sh
  sudo ./studio.sh
  ```
- **udev Rules for Debugger Access**: If your debugger is not recognized,
  create a udev rule:
  ```sh
  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1366", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-segger.rules
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
  ```
- **Java Dependencies**: If Simplicity Studio fails to start, ensure you
  have Java installed:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install default-jre
  ```

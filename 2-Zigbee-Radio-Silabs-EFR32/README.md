# Zigbee Radio — Silabs EFR32MG1B

This section covers the **Zigbee coprocessor** embedded in the gateway: a Silabs EFR32MG1B chip running dedicated wireless firmware.

## Overview

The EFR32MG1B handles all Zigbee radio communication. The stock firmware uses the Tuya protocol, but it can be replaced with open-source alternatives to work with **Zigbee2MQTT**, **ZHA**, or **Matter/Thread**.

## Firmware: NCP (Network Co-Processor)

- The Zigbee stack runs on the EFR32
- Simple setup: just flash and connect to Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA
- Recommended for most users who want a Zigbee coordinator

## Firmware: RCP (Radio Co-Processor)

Two RCP options are available:

### RCP with cpcd + zigbeed (25-RCP-UART-HW)

- Uses Silicon Labs' CPC protocol (Co-Processor Communication)
- Runs with cpcd + zigbeed on the host
- Native multiprotocol support (Zigbee + Thread simultaneously)
- Proprietary but well-supported by Silicon Labs

### OpenThread RCP with zigbee-on-host (26-OT-RCP)

- Standard OpenThread RCP firmware
- Works with [zigbee-on-host](https://github.com/Nerivec/zigbee-on-host) (fully open-source)
- Integrated in Zigbee2MQTT 2.x as the `zoh` adapter
- Simpler setup, community-driven development

## Firmware: Router (SoC)

- Standalone Zigbee 3.0 router, no host required
- Extends your Zigbee mesh network coverage
- Auto-joins open networks via network steering
- Transforms the gateway into a dedicated range extender
